A very simple and easy way to grab player stats from Hyipxel API. Check out Bedwars.java and BedwarsUtils.java to see how to I grab stats for Bedwars.
If you would like to use this code feel free, please just make sure to credit me.
To add other gamemodes for stats, simply create a new abstract GameUtils class similar to BedwarsUtils and extend HGameBase, then create the Game Class and extend the respective Gameutils class.
Proceed to follow how I created Bedwars in your new Game class
